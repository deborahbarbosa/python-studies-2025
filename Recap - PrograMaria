#Recap – Data Analysis Course (PrograMaria) 

##Class 1 - Structured and unstructured data

Data Analysis can be used to 
- Filter data by variables
- Calculate data based on variables
- Group by variables
- Cross and combine data using variáveis 

Data is not information, but we can extract information from data through analysis. 

There are two main types of data: structured and unstructured

**Structured data** is organizaded by rows and columns, such as spreadseehts, databases and CSV files 

**Unstructured data** incluedes imagemes, videos, audio and text - doesn't have a predefined format. 


##Class 2 - Data Filtering and Pivot Table
complemented with content from DigitalOcean 

Filter() can be used to create a new iterator by a previously existing iterator
Is an object capable of returning its elements one at a time, in sequence, alowwing it to be looped over (for example, in a for loop)

Basic syntax of filter() is:

filter(function, iterable)

This returns a filter object, which itself is iterable. 
To get all the items returned by filter(), we can convert it to a list using the list()

Filtered_list = list(filter(function, iterable))

#Why use filter() instead of a list comprehensions?

Filter() is often more efficient than a list comprehensions, especially with large datasets. 

- List comprehensions create a new list and require more processing and memory because the entire list is stored in memory. 
- But filter() return lightweight filter object that references the original iterable without creating a full copy, thus using less memory
