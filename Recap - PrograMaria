#Recap – Data Analysis Course (PrograMaria) 

##Class 1 - Structured and unstructured data

Data Analysis can be used to 
- Filter data by variables
- Calculate data based on variables
- Group by variables
- Cross and combine data using variáveis 

Data is not information, but we can extract information from data through analysis. 

There are two main types of data: structured and unstructured

**Structured data** is organizaded by rows and columns, such as spreadseehts, databases and CSV files 

**Unstructured data** incluedes imagemes, videos, audio and text - doesn't have a predefined format. 

##Class 2 - Data Filtering and Pivot Table
complemented with content from DigitalOcean 

The filter() function can be used to create a new iterador from a previously existing iterable. 
An iterable is an object capable of returbing its elements one at a time, allowing it to be looped over 
(for example, in a for loop) 
que pode sofrer iteração, it will return itens in a sequence that qe can use in a loop for

Basic intasis for filter() is:

filter(function, iterable)
This will return an filter object, that is iterável. 
We can use a function called list() that will bring all the itens return in a filter. 


Filter is more healpful than a compreensão de lista specially if we use a big data. 

Compreensão de lista create another list and it requires more processing. But filter is an simple object related to the original list, and this ocuppies less memory capacity.
